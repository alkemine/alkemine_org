.. warning::

    user_path represents the user-defined Anaconda installation location, the installation directory cannot have Chinese characters.

.. code-block::

    # Take the Anaconda3 version of 5.3 as an example
    # user_path is the Anaconda installation location
    user_path/Anaconda3-5.3
    user_path/Anaconda3-5.3/Scripts

3. **Add Tsinghua source mirror to conda and pip, refer to the specific method:**

Enter the following command to configure `pypi Tsinghua mirror <https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/pypi/>`_

.. code-block:: python

    pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple


Enter the following command to configure `conda Tsinghua mirror <https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/>`_

.. code-block:: python

    conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free/
    conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main/
    conda config --set show_channel_urls yes


.. warning::

    If you do not add the Tsinghua mirror source, there will be a dependency package fastTSNE-0.2.13.tar.gz that cannot be downloaded correctly. You can manually download the 0.2.13 version through the connection and install it through pip https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu. cn/simple/fasttsne/

    There is no fastTSNE package in conda image, and Tsinghua image of pip is required

4. **Create a python3.7 enviroment**

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a python3.7 environment in Anaconda
    conda create --name env_name python==3.7
    # Enter yes after retrieval and wait for the installation to complete

    # Activate the python3.7 environment
    conda activate env_name

.. hint::

Other Common Problems
-----------------------------------------------

1. Can not log in the ALKEMIE.

**Solution**：Please contact the administrator to obtain a license and register an account.

2. Unable to connect the remote database, and unable to submit tasks through remote server.

**Solution**：Currently, the ALKEMIE server is only deployed on the Beihang campus server and the Guangzhou Supercomputing Tianhe server. The off-campus connection to the Beihang campus server can only be accessed through EasyConnect VPN. To connect to the Tianhe supercomputer server, you need to have VPN access through HillStone software and have the permission of the Tianhe computing account. If you cannot connect, please contact the administrator. If you want to build your own server environment, the process is relatively complicated, so please contact the administrator.

3. Encountered the following error during pip install installation:

**Solution**：Please replace the pip mirror to Tsinghua source, because pip currently temporarily suspends support for the fastTSNE software package. For details, refer to step 3 in 2.2.

4. The conda installation process encountered the following warning:

.. image:: image/2-11.png
