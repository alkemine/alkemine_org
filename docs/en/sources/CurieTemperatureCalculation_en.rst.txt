Curie temperature calculation
===================================

Curie temperature calculation. First, configure the workflow parameters in Tc Input. After the workflow calculation is completed, the required data can be obtained from the 'Mananger' output interface; 'Get Data' to obtain the data, and 'Tc Plot' to draw the image.

* Step 1: Connect the controls manually. Or click 'File', 'Open and Freeze', and click to open the corresponding sample template file and click the start button. as shown in the figure:
