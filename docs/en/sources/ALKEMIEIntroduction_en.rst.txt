Introduction
================

When the relationship between the chemical composition and performance of the material is unknown, new materials with special functions are often discovered after a long period of trial and error correction. However, with the rapid development of computing power and technology, traditional concepts are changing. In order to accelerate the research and development of new materials, by combining first-principles databases, data mining and machine learning technologies, the development of high-throughput automatic process material integration calculation algorithms and software becomes crucial. At present, the commonly used high-throughput computing process frameworks (Materials Project, Aflow, etc.) are basically dominated by foreign research groups and the installation "costs" are relatively high. With the concept of material genome, we has developed a set of simple and easy to understand Integrated algorithms and software for high-throughput automatic processes.

ALKEMIE (Artificial Learning and Knowledge Enhanced Materials Informatics Engineering) is a high-throughput automatic process calculation software with multi-scale integration. Led by the team of Professor Sun Zhimei from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, it was developed from scratch based on the python open source framework. The software includes two versions of stand-alone version (full function) and web version (database function). Users can download the stand-alone full version after registering on the web page.

Function
---------------------

* **High-throughput**：ALKEMIE can manage a single user's high-throughput computing tasks over 10000 orders of magnitude.

* **Automation**：ALKEMIE's high-throughput workflow runs automatically from modeling, calculation to data analysis without manual intervention. The running process can use default parameters or user-defined parameters.

* **Visualization**：ALKEMIE designed a user-friendly visual interface based on QT, which makes the high-throughput internal work flow and data transmission method more transparent, more convenient to operate, and convenient for users with different material knowledge backgrounds.

* **Workflow**：ALKEMIE has developed and designed a scientific workflow suitable for a variety of computing software, liberating users from tedious and even difficult calculation processes, and greatly improving calculation and work efficiency.

* **Database**：ALKEMIE has constructed various types of material databases, including material structure databases, workflow databases, material properties databases, file databases, and structural descriptor databases suitable for machine learning.

* **Machine learning**：ALKEMIE has developed models suitable for material structure energy prediction, atomic force prediction and band gap prediction based on a variety of general machine learning tools such as scikit-learn, PyTorch and TensorFlow, and has customized a unified bottom layer for the further development and application of the model.

* **Plug-in mode**：The platform supports the integration of multi-scale and different function calculation modules in plug-in mode. At present, multiple calculation software of different scales have been added, including first-principles calculation software VASP, OpenMX, molecular dynamics software Lammps, ASE, thermodynamic calculation software Gibbs, OpenCalphd and phase field calculation software OpenPhase, etc. Part of the software only provides calculation example functions, which will be further improved in the future.
